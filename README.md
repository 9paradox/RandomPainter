# RandomPainter
Java Swing app/game to play around with random set of colors and do some pixel style painting.

I created this app/game just to test out Java Swing and try out GitHub.

# Random Painter Basics :
- To paint out pixel style art.
- Colors are generated randomly.
- Select a color and start paining on the canvas.
- Click on Random Colors to generate out new colors
- Click on Reset Canvas to clear the canvas.
